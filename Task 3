#Cat and Dog Image Classifier üê±üê∂
-Objective: 
            Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.
-Key Steps:
            Data Collection: Utilized Kaggle dataset containing images of cats and dogs. 
     -TensorFlow Implementation: 
                               Implemented TensorFlow for building and training the image classification model. 
      -Generators from Keras: 
                            Employed Keras generators to efficiently load and preprocess images during training, crucial for handling large datasets.
       -CNN Model Design: 
                        Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a specialized architecture for effective image classification tasks.
